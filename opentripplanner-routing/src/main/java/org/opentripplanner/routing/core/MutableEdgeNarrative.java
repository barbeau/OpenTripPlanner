/**
 * Interface to implement for {@link EdgeNarrative} implementations that wish to indicate that their
 * from and to vertices are mutable. This is useful for {@link EdgeNarrative} objects produced by
 * {@link Edge} implementations where there are multiple potential traversal results and target
 * vertices possible for a particular traversal. When doing reverse optimization in
 * {@link GraphPath}, the {@link Edge} may not actually know the resulting target {@link Vertex}
 * from the initial edge traversal, since it's only stored in the original {@link EdgeNarrative}. By
 * indicating that the reverse-optimized {@link EdgeNarrative}, is mutable, we can reset the
 * {@link EdgeNarrative#getFromVertex()} and {@link EdgeNarrative#getToVertex()} vertices from the
 * original edge narrative as appropriate.
