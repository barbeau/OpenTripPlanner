/**
 * Service classes that need access to core graph objects like {@link Graph},
 * {@link ContractionHierarchySet} and {@link CalendarService} should access
 * them through this service interface. Instead of injecting a {@link Autowired}
 * dependency on {@link Graph}, instead inject an instace of
 * {@link GraphService} and use the {@link #getGraph()} method to access the
 * graph as neeeed.
 * 
 * Why the level of indirection? The service interface allows use to more easily
 * decouple the deserialization, loading, and management of the underlying graph
 * objects from the classes that need access to the objects. This indirection
 * allows us to dynamically swap in a new graph if underlying data changes, for
 * example.
